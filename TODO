   0. Known system issues:
####################################################

2024-10-12: Windows: Unicode in filenames is not supported when compiling under Windows (MinGW). Running games is not affected by this issue, but a folder with game files must have a supported character set in its name. This problem does not apply when compiling under Cygwin.

2024-10-24: Windows/MinGW: There is no support for ANSI colors (ANSI escape codes) in the console. Windows before version 10 has no native support (ANSICON and similar utilities can solve this problem). Windows 10 has native support, but it must be specifically enabled with ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING in SetConsoleMode(handle, mode).

   1. General list:
####################################################

- 2024-02-19: NOTE: Silmarils are drawing UI and game window to separate logic screens. On 4 bit platforms we can easily use separate palettes for each screen to have true 32 color versions

- 2024-03-03: NOTE: script loading is wastly faster on all current platforms, some loadings screens are never displayed or just breafly flash on the screen. We can delay loading for some of those scripts to make it behave more like original.

+ 2024-01-25: 2024-02-05: cfopen, report failure to open file but don't exit

+ 2024-02-14: 2024-02-18: update mouse cursor whenever palette changes

+ 2024-03-06: 2024-03-09: use platform resolution instead of hardcoded 320 x 200

+ 2024-09-22: 2024-10-04: SDL2: SDL_OpenAudio may return an unsupported configuration. Conversion required. Github Issue #11.

+ 2024-09-28: 2024-10-13: Debug/Reports: A runtime Disalis (analog of disassembler for Alis script) for Alis VM (command line option -d). Pull requests #20, #22, #29, #40.

- 2024-09-28: Debug/Reports: Built-in Disalis of Alis script files.

- 2024-10-11: Capturing screenshots. There are several possible implementations here, depending on the task for which the screenshot is taken. Capturing a texture, surface or window. On Mac/Windows with or without window title and border. With or without a cursor. All of these options may be needed for different user tasks.

- 2024-10-11: Improvement: GET_PTR() preprocessor function or macro to replace 'alis.mem + offset' in code to avoid crashing when executing a broken script if it tries to access unallocated memory.

- 2024-10-12: Debug/Reports: Built-in util to unpack Alis script files (unpack mode). Based on and is an updated and reworked version of silm-depack util by Maestun (https://github.com/maestun/silm-depack). Pull requests #29. [In work by Cosmicore].

- 2024-10-13: Debug/Reports: Built-in util to extract resources (text, audio, sample, music, image and video resources) from Alis script files (extract/resource mode). Based on and is an updated and reworked version of silm-extract by Skruug (https://github.com/skruug/silm-extract). Two extraction options: in the original internal Silmarils audio, image and video formats (raw data) and in converted form (bmp, wav, etc.). Commits #0584d10, #497c7f6, #674ac4d, #3e4e101.

- 2024-10-14: Debug/Reports: Built-in util to extract doc-check words. [In work by Cosmicore].

- 2024-10-14: Debug/Reports: Built-in util to convert Alis script files between BE and LE platforms.

- 2024-10-14: Debug/Reports: Built-in util to pack non-packed or unpacked Alis script files. Supported both RLE and LZ like compression methods: old (A0, 80 & 81, C0 & C1), new BYTE60 (PB60, A1), and new WORD60 (PW60, A1) methods. BE and LE platforms.

- 2024-10-15: Improvement: In the course of the project work and analyzing bytecode of scripts of various games it was possible to discover that games on the Alis engine have a built-in developer (or author) mode for debugging during development, sometimes with its own user interface (the most interesting example is Robinson's Requiem menu). The execution of the main script practically starts by detecting whether the system is in developer mode. Although this mode is not cut out of the scripts, it is impossible to enable it on the usual interpreters distributed with the games, because they do not contain the necessary code for activation. It is planned to enable it via the command line (option -a). To access the non-graphical interface of the mode it is necessary to implement the text mode. [In work by Cosmicore].

- 2024-10-15: Debug/Reports: Built-in util to analyze files and output a report (at least about compression type for searching neccessary examples; the algorithm for detecting the files responsible for doc-check is also good for this option) (option -i).

+ 2024-10-17: 2024-01-11: Bug: cbeq8, cbeq16, cbeq24 and cbne8, cbne16, cbne24 perform a jump in the opposite direction from the claimed one. Pull request #40.

# Savestates
- 2024-10-23: Use LE when storing savestate and convert it if loading on BE machines.
- 2024-10-25: Incompatible savestates made on alis compiled on different compilers (CYGWIN and MinGW etc.) due different sizes of some variables and structures (timeval). If the save is done on a different version of alis, the load may not work either, since new variables may have been added to the main structure of the virtual machine (sAlisVM alis) or old variables may have been deleted. Pull requests #35.
- 2024-10-25: Turn off the music and sound when the save state is going to load, otherwise the old sound that was playing before loading continues to play after loading.

- 2024-11-04: YM2149 emulation is imprecise. Sounds in general are slighly off, low frequency sounds like steps are not played at all. Try to replace it with something else.

+ 2024-11-21: 2024-11-21: Activating cheat modes usually requires pressing several buttons at the same time (for example, for Le Fetiche Maya during a car ride, one can press Left Shift + Right Shift + B to immediately end the ride and get to the village). Apparently, we have to test why some combinations don't work for us. Pull request #40.
