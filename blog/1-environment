# The work environment

## Inspiration

Over the past few years, many talented hackers managed to rewrite good old games for modern platforms.
They didn't recode the games from scratch, but instead reimplemented the virtual machines that ran those games.
Here are some examples of those projects:

- ScummVM
- RAW (Rewrite of Another World)

In the early 90's, a lot of home computer models were available on the market, meaning that game developers had to ship many different ports of their games.
Instead of rewriting each game from scratch for a new platform, they wrote their games for custom, in-house virtual machines ("VM").
When shipping a game for a new platform, only the VM was ported (plus some graphics and sound adjustments for the target computer). A huge benefit when the market was moving at a fast pace !
One of those game developers was Silmarils.

## ALIS

I read in an interview somewhere on the web that the Silmarils were running on a in-house virtual machine called ALIS, which ran game scripts at runtime.
